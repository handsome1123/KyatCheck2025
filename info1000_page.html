üßê What are the signs of a counterfeit 1,000 Kyat note?

The counterfeit 1,000 Kyat note can be identified by several distinguishing features that differ from the genuine note.

Here's a guide to help you spot the differences:

‚Ä¢ Color difference: The counterfeit note tends to have a more faded or uneven tone, lacking the vibrant color seen in genuine notes.

‚Ä¢ Cut marks: The counterfeit note often has noticeable cut marks along the edges or corners. (The genuine note does not have these.)

‚Ä¢ Watermark: The watermark, which typically features a prominent image of a lion in the top left corner of the genuine note, is missing in the counterfeit.

‚Ä¢ Security thread: The genuine note contains a security thread with the denomination and the text "MYANMAR" visible. In the counterfeit, this text and security feature may be absent or poorly printed.

‚Ä¢ Hidden features: When held up to light, the genuine note reveals a hidden "1000" watermark embedded into the paper. This feature is typically absent or poorly replicated in counterfeit notes.

‚Ä¢ Texture and feel: The genuine 1,000 Kyat note has a distinct texture, with raised printing and a slightly rough feel. The counterfeit note might feel smooth or flimsy.

By looking out for these features, you can better protect yourself from counterfeit currency.
