  <h2>History of Banknotes in Myanmar</h2>
  <p>
According to Section 8(a) of the Central Bank of Myanmar Law, the Central Bank of Myanmar is the sole issuer of currency notes (or) coins used within the country. To enhance effective payment systems and maintain the stability of the Myanmar kyat, the Bank is implementing various monetary policies.

Before gaining independence from the British, Myanmar was a subordinate state under British India and used the rupee as its currency. The rupee used in both India and Myanmar was pegged to the British pound sterling at the rate of one shilling and six pence.

Under the first plan of the 1946 Currency and Coinage Act, currency notes in denominations of 1, 5, 10, and 100 rupees were issued, followed by 20 and 50 rupee coins under the second plan. These notes bore the watermark and were authorized by the Board’s Chairman. The notes were printed with the phrase “Burma Currency Board Legal Tender in Burma Only” in English, meaning they were valid for use only within Burma.

After Myanmar gained independence from Britain, the country became the Union of Burma and the currency note header was changed to “Government of the Union of Burma.” Indian-issued notes bearing the phrase “Legal Tender Currency in Burma Only” were withdrawn, and starting from July 1, 1948, the Government of the Union of Burma began issuing new currency notes. However, by July 20, 1950, all coin denominations were withdrawn from circulation.

In 1952, the People's Bank of the Union of Burma Law was enacted, transferring the sole authority to issue currency from the Burma Currency Board to the Currency Department of the People’s Bank of Burma. As of July 1, 1952, the Central Bank's operations officially began. Rights and responsibilities previously held by the Currency Board were transferred to the People’s Bank of Burma. One significant reform during this time was the transition to a decimal currency system.

Coins were made of nickel and issued in denominations of 1 mu, 1 pya, 2 pya, 4 pya, and 8 pya. All coins bore an image of a lion on the front, and the denomination and minting year were enclosed in a floral design on the reverse. However, on November 1, 1953, the 1 mu, 1 pya, and 2 pya coins were withdrawn. Furthermore, in 1952, the currency name was changed from rupee to kyat, with the decimal system based on 100 pyas. Previously, 1 rupee equaled 16 annas and 64 pice; after conversion, 1 kyat equaled 100 pyas.

After assuming the responsibilities of a central bank, the People’s Bank of Burma introduced new banknote series from July 1, 1952. The notes included 1, 5, 10, and 100 rupee denominations, and were later denominated in kyats. These notes featured an image of a peacock. A second series issued in 1958 featured a portrait of General Aung San in military uniform with a hat. On Union Day, February 12, 1958, 1, 5, 10, and 100 kyat notes were released, followed by the 20 and 50 kyat notes in August. These were the first currency notes issued solely by Myanmar.

Decimal currency coins included denominations of 1, 5, 10, 25, and 50 pyas, as well as 1 kyat, and were minted by the Royal Mint. While the designs included various markings, the Burmese lion symbol (or an image of a lion) remained. The 5 and 10 pya coins were first circulated on October 1, 1952.

Under the Revolutionary Council Government, the 50 and 100 kyat notes were demonetized on May 17, 1964. Subsequently, new notes in denominations of 1, 5, 10, and 20 kyats featuring the image of General Aung San in military uniform were introduced on April 30, 1965. These notes continued to be considered legal tender unless officially demonetized.
