    <h1>📌 How to Identify Counterfeit and Genuine Banknotes</h1>
    <p>
      "Before talking about counterfeits, let’s understand the features of genuine banknotes."

      As technology advances, counterfeit money has also become more sophisticated. That’s why it’s important — especially for bank staff and others who handle cash — to be familiar with how to distinguish genuine notes from fake ones. Even without LED lights or microscopes, there are key features you can check.
    </p>

    <h2>🔍 Main Features of Genuine Banknotes</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>💧 Watermark – Visible when held up to the light.</li>
      <li>🌟 Embossed Print – Raised ink you can feel with your fingers.</li>
      <li>🎨 Geometric Lathe Work – Fine line patterns created with precision techniques.</li>
      <li>🔬 Micro Printing – Very tiny text that may require magnification to read.</li>
      <li>🖍️ Optically Variable Ink – Ink that changes color when viewed from different angles.</li>
      <li>🌀 Holograms – Multi-dimensional images visible from different perspectives.</li>
      <li>🔗 Security Thread – A thin embedded strip running through the note.</li>
      <li>🧲 Magnetic Ink – Contains magnetic properties detectable by machines.</li>
      <li>🔢 Serial Number – Each note has a unique number.</li>
      <li>⛔ Anti-Copy Mark – Special patterns or marks that cannot be photocopied.</li>
      <li>📄 Copy-Evident Paper – Paper that shows visible signs if photocopied.</li>
      <li>💡 Fluorescent Dyes – Dyes that glow under UV light.</li>
      <li>🧭 Registration Feature on Both Sides – Designs that align perfectly on the front and back when held up to the light.</li>
      <li>⚙️ Electronic Devices – Features readable by machines.</li>
      <li>🌡️ Thermochromatic Ink – Ink that changes color with heat.</li>
      <li>👁️ Latent Image – Hidden images that appear only at specific angles.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>📌 So what about counterfeit notes?</h2>
    <p>
      Counterfeit notes might imitate some of the features above but not all. And some security features can only be seen using tools like UV light or microscopes. That means we can’t always identify fake money just by a quick glance.
    </p>

    <h2>🧠 So, how should we assess it at a glance?</h2>
    <p>
      That’s the question! Although not all features are visible to the naked eye, being aware of as many genuine indicators as possible gives you the best chance to spot a fake.
